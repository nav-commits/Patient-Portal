  // Blood cells
  WBC: "White blood cells are part of your immune system. They fight infections and help protect your body from germs.",
  RBC: "Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body and bring carbon dioxide back to be exhaled.",
  Hemoglobin: "Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Low levels can make you feel tired.",
  Hematocrit: "Hematocrit shows the percentage of your blood made up of red blood cells, which affects how well your blood carries oxygen.",
  "Platelet Count": "Platelets help your blood clot. Low levels can cause easy bruising or bleeding.",

  // Red blood cell details
  MCV: "Mean Corpuscular Volume measures the average size of your red blood cells. Abnormal sizes can indicate anemia or vitamin deficiency.",
  MCH: "Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin measures the amount of hemoglobin in each red blood cell, which affects oxygen delivery.",
  MCHC: "Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration shows the concentration of hemoglobin inside red blood cells.",
  RDW: "Red Cell Distribution Width measures variation in red blood cell size. High variation can suggest anemia or other blood disorders.",

  // White blood cell types
  Neutrophil: "Neutrophils are white blood cells that fight bacterial infections.",
  Lymphocyte: "Lymphocytes help your body fight viruses and support overall immune function.",
  Monocyte: "Monocytes remove dead cells and help clean up infections.",
  Eosinophil: "Eosinophils respond to allergies and parasitic infections.",
  Basophil: "Basophils are involved in inflammation and allergic reactions.",

  // Urine tests
  SpecificGravity: "Shows how concentrated your urine is, which helps check hydration and kidney function.",
  pH: "Measures acidity or alkalinity of urine. Abnormal levels may indicate infection or kidney issues.",
  "Sugar (Urine)": "Checks for glucose in urine. High levels may suggest diabetes or high blood sugar.",
  "Protein (Urine)": "Detects protein in urine. High levels may signal kidney damage.",
  Ketone: "Measures ketones in urine, which can build up when your body burns fat for energy instead of glucose.",
  Blood: "Detects blood in urine, which could indicate infection, kidney stones, or injury.",
  Leukocytes: "White blood cells in urine can indicate a urinary tract infection.",
  Nitrite: "Nitrite in urine often indicates bacterial infection.",

  // Blood sugar & diabetes
  "Glucose Fasting": "Measures blood sugar after fasting. Helps diagnose diabetes or monitor blood sugar control.",
  HbA1C: "Shows your average blood sugar over the past 2–3 months. Important for diabetes management.",

  // Kidney function
  Creatinine: "Waste from muscles that your kidneys filter. High levels may mean kidney problems.",
  eGFR: "Estimates how well your kidneys are filtering blood. Low values indicate reduced kidney function.",
  "MicroalbuminRDMU": "Detects small amounts of protein in urine, an early sign of kidney damage.",
  "Urine Creatinine": "Measures kidney function by analyzing creatinine in urine.",
  "MAL/Creat Ratio1": "Shows ratio of protein to creatinine in urine to detect kidney problems early.",
  "MAL/Creat Ratio2": "Repeat test to confirm protein to creatinine ratio in urine.",

  // Electrolytes & minerals
  Sodium: "Regulates fluid balance, blood pressure, and nerve function.",
  Potassium: "Essential for heart, muscle, and nerve function.",
  Chloride: "Helps maintain fluid balance and acid-base balance in the body.",

  // Liver & enzymes
  "Alk Phosphatase": "Enzyme linked to liver and bone health. High levels may indicate liver or bone issues.",
  "ALT (SGPT)": "Liver enzyme. High levels may suggest liver damage or inflammation.",

  // Muscle & heart
  "CPK-Total": "Enzyme from muscles. High levels may indicate muscle damage or heart problems.",

  // Uric acid & fats
  "Uric Acid": "Waste from cells and diet. High levels can cause gout or kidney stones.",
  Cholesterol: "Fat in your blood. Needed for cells but too much can increase heart disease risk.",
  Triglycerides: "Type of blood fat used for energy. High levels increase risk of heart disease.",
  "HDL Cholesterol": "Good cholesterol that helps remove bad cholesterol from your arteries.",
  "LDL Cholesterol": "Bad cholesterol that can build up in arteries, increasing heart risk.",
  "Chol:HDL Ratio": "Ratio of total cholesterol to good cholesterol. Higher values mean higher heart risk.",
  "NON-HDL Choleste": "All cholesterol except good HDL. Helps estimate heart disease risk.",

  // Thyroid & hormones
  Fasting: "Length of time without food before blood test. Needed for accurate results.",
  "TSH Ultra-sens": "Thyroid hormone test. Shows if your thyroid is underactive or overactive.",

  // Vitamins & nutrients
  "Vitamin B12": "Needed for red blood cells and nerve health. Low levels can cause fatigue or numbness.",
  Ferritin: "Stores iron in your body. Low levels may cause anemia, high levels may indicate inflammation.",
  "VitD 25Hydroxy": "Measures vitamin D, important for bone health, immunity, and overall wellness.",

  // Hepatitis tests
  "Anti-HBs": "Shows protection against Hepatitis B, either from vaccination or past infection.",
  "Anti-HCV": "Shows if you have Hepatitis C infection.",
  "Anti-HAV": "Shows if you have immunity to Hepatitis A, from past infection or vaccination.",
